# odin-recipes

This is the first project that I am attempting on The Odin Project's curriculum. 
This project is a basic recipe website. I am going to be applying my knowledge in Git and HTML in order to solidify them as skills. I have high hopes, it is very exciting to finally be doing work in HTML!
