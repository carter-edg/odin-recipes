    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti is a classic meal that every family should try! Make the italians in your life happy by making this!</p>
    <p>Spaghetti is so easy to make that you might make this one every night! And it's so good, you'll want to eat it every night as well!!</p>
    <p><strong>Warning: The following recipe is <em>fictional</em>, intentionally silly, and should not be recreated!</strong></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>132 noodles. No more, no less.</li>
        <li>1 jar of spaghetti sauce of your choice</li>
        <li>8 pounds of garlic bread (per person)</li>
        <li>A DVD copy of "The Godfather Part III" to set the mood</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make a meatloaf</li>
        <li>Throw it away, because that's not what we're making!</li>
        <li>Wait. We could have just cut it up and used it as meatballs!</li>
        <li>Contemplate pulling the meatloaf out of the garbage.</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Break apart all of the dry noodles multiple times, then throw them in the pot.</li>
        <li>Boil them until the look like noodles. Which they already did even before you put them in, so... bring them out immediately?</li>
        <li>These noodles will be very "al dente" and crunchy!</li>
        <li>Warm up the store bought spaghetti sauce you got in the microwave because you are not paid enough to care enough to use a "stove".</li>
        <li>Serve on a plate or a bowl. Maybe someone will get mad at you for using one or the other, but that does not matter. It's your spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Top with the meatballs we made earlier.</li>
    </ol>
